# Active Context: Database Synchronization Utility

## 1. Current Work Focus (as of 2025-06-04 12:42)

-   **Phase:** Post-Implementation Bug Fix.
-   **Activity:** Addressed a runtime error related to `configparser` incorrectly parsing the `%` symbol in the SQL query within `config.ini`.
-   **Objective:** Ensure the script can correctly read its configuration and run without parsing errors.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

-   **Bug Fix:** Modified `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/config.ini`. The SQL query `LIKE 'Stock%'` was changed to `LIKE 'Stock%%'` to correctly escape the `%` for `configparser`.
-   **Previous State:** Initial implementation of `sync_script.py` and project files was complete. `README.md` was added for setup/run instructions.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **User Action: Re-run Script:** The user needs to navigate to the `mysql_to_sqlite_sync` directory (ensure virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed) and re-run `python sync_script.py`.
2.  **User Action: Verify Output:** The user should check for the creation of `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/data/local_vehicles_stock.db` and inspect its contents, and confirm the previous error is resolved.
3.  **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md` to reflect the bug fix.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

-   **Runtime Environment:** Ensure the user has Python and pip installed. The script assumes a standard Python environment.
-   **Database Connectivity:** The script relies on network access to `143.42.30.41:3306`. Firewalls or network issues could prevent connection.
-   **MySQL Driver:** `mysql-connector-python` is specified. If the user's Python environment has issues with it, alternatives might be needed (though it's generally reliable).
-   **Error Reporting:** The script includes basic logging. The user should check console output for errors if the script fails.
-   **Data Volume/Performance:** For very large datasets, the current approach might be slow. This can be addressed later if it becomes an issue.
-   **Dockerization:** The user mentioned a Docker environment for production. The current script is a good base for containerization.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)

-   **Documentation First:** Adherence to the Memory Bank protocol, ensuring documentation is established before/during development.
-   **Iterative Approach:** Start with core functionality and build upon it.
-   **User-Centric Configuration:** Make the utility easy for the user to configure and adapt.
