# Active Context: Database Synchronization Utility

## 1. Current Work Focus (as of 2025-06-04 17:33)

-   **Phase:** Feature Implementation Verified.
-   **Activity:**
    -   User successfully created the `vehicles_db` database in Azure.
    -   User re-ran the `sync_script.py`.
    -   The script successfully connected to Azure MySQL (using SSL), used the local SQLite DB as a fallback source (as primary external DB was unavailable), and wrote 3860 rows to the `vehicles_stock` table in the Azure `vehicles_db` database.
-   **Objective:** Core task of synchronizing data to Azure MySQL, with fallback and target selection, is now working.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

-   **User Action Confirmation:** User created Azure DB and ran script successfully.
-   **Azure CLI Command Provided:** Previously gave the user the command to create the `vehicles_db` database.
-   **`sync_script.py` SSL Fix:** Previously modified `write_data_to_azure_mysql` for correct SSL arguments.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **Update Memory Bank:**
    -   Update `progress.md` to reflect the successful synchronization and completion of the main task.
2.  **User Consideration (Optional):**
    -   Further testing of different scenarios (e.g., primary source available, targeting local SQLite explicitly) if desired.
    -   Monitoring the solution.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

-   **Azure Database Creation:** Resolved.
-   **User Permissions on Azure:** Resolved (implicitly, as the write was successful).
-   **Script Functionality:** Core requested features are now operational.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Reinforced)

-   **Iterative Debugging & User Collaboration:** Successfully resolved issues through collaboration.
-   **Configuration-Driven & Flexible Script:** The script's design allowed for addressing these issues and achieving the desired outcome.
