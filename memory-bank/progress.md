# Project Progress: Database Synchronization Utility

## Project 1: Database Synchronization Utility

### 1.1. Current Status (as of 2025-06-04 17:34 - COMPLETED)

-   **Overall:** Successfully Implemented and Verified. The script synchronizes data to Azure MySQL, using local SQLite as a fallback source if the primary external DB is unavailable. All core requirements of that task were met.
-   **Milestone:** End-to-end synchronization to Azure MySQL with fallback was operational and confirmed by user.

### 1.2. What Worked / Completed (Sync Utility)

-   **Documentation:** All core Memory Bank files were updated to reflect the final successful state of the sync utility.
-   **Configuration (`config.ini`):** Fully configured and functional for all sources/targets for the sync utility.
-   **Core Logic (`sync_script.py`):**
    -   Azure MySQL Target: SSL argument handling fixed and write operation confirmed successful.
    -   Fallback Source: Confirmed working when primary external DB is unavailable.
    -   Command-Line Interface: Operational for target selection.
    -   Main Orchestration: Logic for source/target selection and fallback worked as intended.
-   **Azure Database Setup (for Sync):** User successfully created `vehicles_db` and permissions were sufficient.
-   **Successful Test Run (Sync):** User confirmed script wrote 3860 rows to Azure MySQL using the fallback source.

### 1.3. What's Left to Build / To Do (Sync Utility - Optional/Future)

1.  **User Actions (Optional):** Further testing of different scenarios, monitoring.
2.  **Refinement & Packaging (Future - Optional):** Enhanced error handling, credential management, Dockerization (originally for script, now separate API project), unit tests.

### 1.4. Known Issues / Blockers (Sync Utility)

-   All known issues for the sync utility were resolved.

### 1.5. Evolution of Project Decisions (Sync Utility)

-   Initial Setup: Core Memory Bank, initial script for MySQL to SQLite.
-   Major Enhancement: Added Azure MySQL target, fallback source logic, CLI target selection.
-   Bug Fix (SSL): Corrected SSL arguments for Azure.
-   Blocker Resolution (Azure DB): User created the `vehicles_db` in Azure.
-   Successful Verification: User confirmed the script worked as intended.

## Project 2: Vehicle Search API (New as of 2025-06-04 17:47, Updated 2025-06-18 12:20)

### 2.1. Current Status

-   **Overall:** GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy-to-azure.yml`) updated to fix ACR login issue.
-   **Milestone:**
    -   API development complete.
    -   Azure infrastructure provisioned.
    -   GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD created and subsequently updated to correct ACR authentication.
    -   Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated.
-   **Next Step:** User to commit and push the updated workflow file to trigger deployment. **Update (2025-06-18 14:15):** User confirmed deployment and API test were successful.

### 2.2. What Works / Completed (API Project)

-   **Project Definition:** Task to create FastAPI with Docker for querying Azure MySQL `vehicles_stock` table, secured by API key.
-   **Schema Identification:** `vehicles_stock` columns identified.
-   **`_inv` Field Fallback Logic:** Implemented in `vehicle_search_api/app/main.py`.
-   **Azure Resource Creation:**
    -   Resource Group: `concesur-rg`
    -   ACR: `concesurvehicleapicr`
    -   App Service Plan: `concesurvehicleapiplan`
    -   App Service: `concesur-vehicle-api`
    -   Service Principal: `GitHubActionsVehicleAPI` (with Contributor and AcrPush roles).
-   **GitHub Secrets Configuration:** User confirmed all necessary secrets are added.
-   **GitHub Actions Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-to-azure.yml` created and updated to use correct Service Principal credentials for ACR login.
-   **Memory Bank Updates:** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated.


### 2.3. What's Left to Build / To Do (API Project - High-Level)

1.  **User Action: Commit and Push Updated Workflow:**
    -   User to commit changes to `.github/workflows/deploy-to-azure.yml` to their repository.
    -   User to push the commit to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Action.
2.  **Monitor GitHub Action:**
    -   Observed the workflow run in the GitHub "Actions" tab.
3.  **Deployment Verification & Testing (Completed as per user feedback 2025-06-18 14:15):**
    -   API tested successfully at `https://concesur-vehicle-api.azurewebsites.net`.
    -   Test query: `curl -X GET "https://concesur-vehicle-api.azurewebsites.net/cars/?color=rojo" -H "X-API-Key: Q9iPw1UpAY5s8RKxZPZEwRMFVH6yqK9UzAHj3rvjqmDua9Fzf7UwumqGZTM5MA80loFSbdQFyrVoPgp9PuUKIjQrpjWurAz7kUXSNK47f6Api2ogfwwe5ZyU9TgiTiY6"` was successful.
    -   Interactive API documentation available at `/docs`.
4.  **Documentation:**
    -   Memory Bank updates completed.
    -   Consider adding API usage details to `vehicle_search_api/README.md`.

### 2.4. Known Issues / Blockers (API Project)

-   None. API deployment and testing confirmed successful by user.

### 2.5. Evolution of Project Decisions (API Project)

-   Initial request for FastAPI with Docker to query Azure DB.
-   Decision to use API Key authentication.
-   Decision to leverage existing `vehicles_stock` table and its schema (derived from local sync copy).
-   Decision to organize API project in a new `vehicle_search_api/` directory.
-   Decision to deploy to Azure App Service using Docker containers.
-   Decision to implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
