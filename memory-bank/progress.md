# Project Progress: Database Synchronization Utility

## 1. Current Status (as of 2025-06-04 17:34)

-   **Overall:** Successfully Implemented and Verified. The script now synchronizes data to Azure MySQL, using local SQLite as a fallback source if the primary external DB is unavailable. All core requirements of the task have been met.
-   **Milestone:** End-to-end synchronization to Azure MySQL with fallback is operational and confirmed by user.

## 2. What Works / Completed

-   **Documentation:**
    -   All core Memory Bank files updated to reflect the final successful state.
-   **Configuration (`config.ini`):**
    -   Fully configured and functional for all sources/targets.
-   **Core Logic (`sync_script.py`):**
    -   **Azure MySQL Target:** SSL argument handling fixed and write operation confirmed successful.
    -   **Fallback Source:** Confirmed working when primary external DB is unavailable.
    -   **Command-Line Interface:** Operational for target selection.
    -   **Main Orchestration:** Logic for source/target selection and fallback is working as intended.
-   **Azure Database Setup:**
    -   User successfully created the `vehicles_db` database in Azure.
    -   Permissions for `adminconce` user were sufficient for the script to write data.
-   **Successful Test Run:** User confirmed script wrote 3860 rows to Azure MySQL using the fallback source.

## 3. What's Left to Build / To Do (High-Level)

1.  **User Actions (Optional):**
    *   **Further Testing:** User may wish to test other scenarios (e.g., primary source available, explicitly targeting local SQLite with `python sync_script.py --target local_sqlite`).
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement any desired monitoring for the script if it's run on a schedule.
2.  **Refinement & Packaging (Future - Optional):**
    *   As previously listed (enhanced error handling based on wider use, credential management, Docker, unit tests).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **Resolved:** The "Azure Database Missing" issue has been resolved by the user creating the database.
-   No outstanding critical blockers for the defined task.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Setup:** Core Memory Bank, initial script for MySQL to SQLite.
-   **Major Enhancement:** Added Azure MySQL target, fallback source logic, CLI target selection.
-   **Bug Fix (SSL):** Corrected SSL arguments for Azure.
-   **Blocker Resolution (Azure DB):** User created the `vehicles_db` in Azure, resolving the "Unknown database" error.
-   **Successful Verification:** User confirmed the script now works as intended, writing data to Azure MySQL using the fallback mechanism.
