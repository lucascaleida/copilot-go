# Project Progress: Database Synchronization Utility

## Project 1: Database Synchronization Utility

### 1.1. Current Status (as of 2025-06-04 17:34 - COMPLETED)

-   **Overall:** Successfully Implemented and Verified. The script synchronizes data to Azure MySQL, using local SQLite as a fallback source if the primary external DB is unavailable. All core requirements of that task were met.
-   **Milestone:** End-to-end synchronization to Azure MySQL with fallback was operational and confirmed by user.

### 1.2. What Worked / Completed (Sync Utility)

-   **Documentation:** All core Memory Bank files were updated to reflect the final successful state of the sync utility.
-   **Configuration (`config.ini`):** Fully configured and functional for all sources/targets for the sync utility.
-   **Core Logic (`sync_script.py`):**
    -   Azure MySQL Target: SSL argument handling fixed and write operation confirmed successful.
    -   Fallback Source: Confirmed working when primary external DB is unavailable.
    -   Command-Line Interface: Operational for target selection.
    -   Main Orchestration: Logic for source/target selection and fallback worked as intended.
-   **Azure Database Setup (for Sync):** User successfully created `vehicles_db` and permissions were sufficient.
-   **Successful Test Run (Sync):** User confirmed script wrote 3860 rows to Azure MySQL using the fallback source.

### 1.3. What's Left to Build / To Do (Sync Utility - Optional/Future)

1.  **User Actions (Optional):** Further testing of different scenarios, monitoring.
2.  **Refinement & Packaging (Future - Optional):** Enhanced error handling, credential management, Dockerization (originally for script, now separate API project), unit tests.

### 1.4. Known Issues / Blockers (Sync Utility)

-   All known issues for the sync utility were resolved.

### 1.5. Evolution of Project Decisions (Sync Utility)

-   Initial Setup: Core Memory Bank, initial script for MySQL to SQLite.
-   Major Enhancement: Added Azure MySQL target, fallback source logic, CLI target selection.
-   Bug Fix (SSL): Corrected SSL arguments for Azure.
-   Blocker Resolution (Azure DB): User created the `vehicles_db` in Azure.
-   Successful Verification: User confirmed the script worked as intended.

## Project 2: Vehicle Search API (New as of 2025-06-04 17:47, Updated 2025-06-18 10:51)

### 2.1. Current Status

-   **Overall:** API development in progress. Core application structure (`main.py`) exists. Key feature for `_inv` field fallback implemented.
-   **Milestone:** Implemented fallback logic for `marca_inv`/`modelo_inv` in API responses. Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated to reflect this.

### 2.2. What Works / Completed (API Project)

-   **Project Definition:** Task to create FastAPI with Docker for querying Azure MySQL `vehicles_stock` table, secured by API key.
-   **Schema Identification:** `vehicles_stock` columns identified from local SQLite DB.
-   **Memory Bank Update (Initial):** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this `progress.md` file were updated to include the API project.
-   **`_inv` Field Fallback Logic (2025-06-18):**
    -   Modified `vehicle_search_api/app/main.py` to select `marca_inv` and `modelo_inv`.
    -   Implemented logic to use `_inv` field values for `marca` and `modelo` in the API response if the `_inv` fields are not empty/null, otherwise using the standard fields.
-   **Memory Bank Update (Post-Feature):** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the `_inv` fallback implementation.


### 2.3. What's Left to Build / To Do (API Project - High-Level)

1.  **Create Project Structure:**
    -   New directory: `vehicle_search_api/`
2.  **Develop API Application:**
    -   `vehicle_search_api/.env` file (API key, DB credentials).
    -   `vehicle_search_api/requirements.txt`.
    -   `vehicle_search_api/app/main.py` (FastAPI app, endpoint, DB logic, auth).
    -   Pydantic models for request/response.
3.  **Dockerize:**
    -   `vehicle_search_api/Dockerfile`.
    -   `vehicle_search_api/docker-compose.yml` (optional, for local dev).
4.  **Testing:**
    -   Unit tests (optional, future).
    -   Integration tests (API endpoint testing with live DB connection).
5.  **Documentation:**
    -   Ensure Memory Bank is fully up-to-date upon completion.
    -   API usage documentation (e.g., in a README within `vehicle_search_api/`).

### 2.4. Known Issues / Blockers (API Project)

-   None identified yet. Azure DB credentials will be needed for the `.env` file.

### 2.5. Evolution of Project Decisions (API Project)

-   Initial request for FastAPI with Docker to query Azure DB.
-   Decision to use API Key authentication.
-   Decision to leverage existing `vehicles_stock` table and its schema (derived from local sync copy).
-   Decision to organize API project in a new `vehicle_search_api/` directory.
