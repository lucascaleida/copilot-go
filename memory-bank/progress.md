# Project Progress: Database Synchronization Utility

## 1. Current Status (as of 2025-06-04 12:42)

-   **Overall:** Addressed a runtime bug in `config.ini` parsing. Script should now correctly read configuration. Ready for user to re-test.
-   **Milestone:** Core script implementation complete, initial bug fix applied.

## 2. What Works / Completed

-   **Documentation:**
    -   All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) created and updated.
    -   `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/README.md` created with setup and run instructions.
-   **Information Gathering:** User provided necessary details for MySQL connection, query, and SQLite setup.
-   **Project Structure:**
    -   `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/` directory created.
    -   `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/requirements.txt` created.
    -   `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/config.ini` created and subsequently fixed for `%` parsing.
    -   `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/.gitignore` created.
-   **Core Logic (`sync_script.py`):**
    -   Configuration loading from `config.ini`.
    -   Logging implemented.
    -   Function to connect to MySQL and fetch data.
    -   Function to write data to SQLite.
    -   Main orchestrating function.
-   **Bug Fix:**
    -   Corrected `config.ini` to use `Stock%%` instead of `Stock%` in the SQL query to prevent `configparser` errors.

## 3. What's Left to Build / To Do (High-Level)

1.  **User Actions (Immediate):**
    *   Set up Python virtual environment in `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/`.
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   Run the script: `python sync_script.py`.
    *   Verify the output: Check `mysql_to_sqlite_sync/data/local_vehicles_stock.db`.
2.  **Testing (by User):**
    *   Confirm successful connection to MySQL.
    *   Confirm data is correctly fetched and matches the source view (for the given query).
    *   Confirm data is correctly written to the local SQLite database.
3.  **Refinement & Packaging (Future - Optional, based on user feedback):**
    *   Add command-line arguments (e.g., to specify config file path).
    *   Enhance error handling and user feedback based on testing.
    *   Consider alternative credential management (e.g., environment variables, especially for Docker).
    *   Develop Dockerfile for containerization.
    *   Unit tests for individual functions.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **Untested Script (Post-Fix):** The script with the `config.ini` fix has not yet been run by the user. Connectivity to MySQL and overall functionality need to be confirmed.
-   **Python Environment:** Relies on the user having a compatible Python (3.7+) and pip setup.
-   **Network Access:** Requires network connectivity to the external MySQL database.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Decision:** Opted for creating all core Memory Bank files at the outset.
-   **Information Received:** User confirmed MySQL as the database type and provided connection details.
-   **Implementation Choice:** Used `pandas` and `SQLAlchemy` for database operations. `configparser` for configuration.
-   **Password Handling:** Stored password in `config.ini` for initial simplicity, with advice to secure it and use `.gitignore`.
-   **Bug Identification & Fix:** User feedback identified a `configparser` issue with `%` in SQL query. Fixed by escaping `%` to `%%` in `config.ini`.
